(* This module defines the jobs of the [code_verification] pipeline.

   This pipeline comes in two variants:

   - The [before_merging] pipeline runs on merge requests. Jobs in
   this pipeline are conditional on the set of [~changes] in the merge
   request. The goal is to only run those jobs whose outcome is
   affected by the merge request.

   - The [schedule_extended_test] pipeline runs daily on the [master]
   branch. It contains a set of jobs that are too slow to run in merge
   request pipelines and a large subset of the [before_merging]
   pipeline in addition. This subset excludes jobs that are irrelevant
   in a non-merge request context, like the commit title check. Jobs
   in this pipeline should run [Always] -- unless they depend on
   artifacts of another job in which case they should run
   [On_success]. The goal of this pipeline is to catch any breaking
   changes that might've slipped through the [before_merging]
   pipeline.

   When adding new jobs to the [code_verification] pipeline, make sure
   that it appears in both variants as applicable, with the
   appropriate rules. *)
