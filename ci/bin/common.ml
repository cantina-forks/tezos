    default value for [~before_merging] for all jobs. Each boolean flag
    of this function enables a specific functionality before the job's
    [script:] runs. In detail:

    - [take_ownership]: all files in the working directory of the
      job are [chown]'d by the job's user. This requires that either
      sudo is installed in the job's image or that the job's user has
      sufficient privileges. (default: [false])
    - [source_version]: the script [scripts/version.sh] is sourced. (default: [false])
    - [eval_opam]: runs [eval $(opam env)], activating any opam switch
      if present in the image. (default: [false])
    - [init_python_venv]: runs [.venv/bin/activate], activating any
      python vinv if present in the image. (default: [false])
    - [install_js_deps]: runs, and sources,
      [./scripts/install_build_deps.js.sh] installing JavaScript
      dependencies and [node], [nvm] and [npm] available in the
      environment. (default: [false])

    stored, and the path that will be cached. By default, the [key]
    contains the name of the job, thus scoping the cache to all
    instances of that job. By default, [path] is the folder
    ["$CI_PROJECT_DIR/_sccache"], and this function also sets the
    environment dir [SCCACHE_DIR] such that sccache stores its caches
    there.

    - [error_log], [idle_timeout] and [log] sets the environment
    variables [SCCACHE_ERROR_LOG], [SCCACHE_IDLE_TIMEOUT] and
    [SCCACHE_LOG] respectively. See the sccache documentation for more
    information on these variables. *)
