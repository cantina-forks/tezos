Development Changelog
'''''''''''''''''''''

**NB:** The changelog for releases can be found at: https://tezos.gitlab.io/CHANGES.html


This file lists the changes added to each version of octez-node,
octez-client, and the other Octez executables. The changes to the economic
protocol are documented in the ``docs/protocols/`` directory; in
particular in ``docs/protocols/alpha.rst``.

When you make a commit on master, you can add an item in one of the
following subsections (node, client, â€¦) to document your commit or the
set of related commits. This will ensure that this change is not
forgotten in the final changelog, which can be found in ``docs/CHANGES.rst``.
By having your commits update this file you also make it easy to find the
commits which are related to your changes using ``git log -p -- CHANGES.rst``.
Relevant items are moved to ``docs/CHANGES.rst`` after each release.

Only describe changes which affect users (bug fixes and new features),
or which will affect users in the future (deprecated features),
not refactorings or tests. Changes to the documentation do not need to
be documented here either.

General
-------

- Add and **experimental** switch to enable the use of the Brassaia context
  backend using ``TEZOS_CONTEXT_BACKEND=Brassaia`` environment variable. (MR :gl:`!13054`)

Node
----

- Add an ``source`` argument to ``GET
  /chains/<chain>/mempool/pending_operations`` which allows operations
  to be filtered by source. (MR :gl:`!11278`)

- Add an RPC
  ``/chains/<chain>/blocks/<block>/context/smart_rollups/smart_rollup/<sr1...>/consumed_outputs/<outbox_level>``
  that returns the consumed output's indexes for the given outbox
  level. (MR :gl:`!12776`)

Smart Rollup node
-----------------

- Updated RPC ``/local/batcher/injection`` with a new query argument
  possibility. When the rpc contains ``"drop_duplicate": true`` then
  the batcher will drop the messages that were already injected with a
  previous RPC call.  If ``"drop_duplicate": false`` then the rollup
  node defaults to its the previous behavior, where messages are
  injected again, even if the exact same one was previously
  injected. By default ``"drop_duplicate": false``. (MR :gl:`!13165`)

- RPC ``/health`` now returns meaningful health related data to asses if the
  rollup node operates correctly. Old ``/health`` RPC is renamed to ``/ping``.
  (MR :gl:`!12940`)

- Support for unsafely increasing the WASM PVM's tick limit of a rollup.
  (MRs :gl:`!12907`, :gl:`!12957`, :gl:`!12983`)

- Use a local cache per game for intermediate states of dissections. (MR
  :gl:`!12899`)

- Introduce the 5th version of the WASM PVM, which defaults to a higher tick
  limits to delegate refutability to the kernels. (MR :gl:`!12999`)

- Trigger GC every 1000 blocks (instead of 100) by default to reduce CPU
  consumption. (MR :gl:`!13177`)
